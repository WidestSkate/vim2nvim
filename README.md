# vim2nvim
Just makes a new command that lets you type vim to open neovim for all the people like me who type the wrong one : /
# installation

`git clone https://github.com/WidestSkate/vim2nvim.git` Clones the Repo

`sudo gcc vim2nvim/vim2nvim.c -o /bin/vim` Creates the binary in the bin dir

# Usage 

Just replaces the vim command with the nvim one so you can just use it how you normally would e.g

`vim` to open the neovim editor
`vim path/to/a/file` to open a specific file in neovim
